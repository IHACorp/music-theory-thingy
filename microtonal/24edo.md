# Tricks
## Tritone to P5
https://youtu.be/bWG6CGKMnNA?t=106

+ = half sharp, not aug

Tritones usually wanna resolve inward by half step forming a M3

But you can move them outward by quarter step forming a P5
```
                         F+ - Up Quarter
F     Down Half     F       |       
    E  -                    |
       | M3                 | P5
    C  -                    |
B      Up Half      B       | 
                         Bd - Down Quarter

Ex:
G7  CM7 (I)         G7  Bd (VIId) (min or maj, whatever)
    M3: 1 3             P5: 1 5
                        
    FM7 (IV)            G+Maj (V+M7)
    M3: 5 7             P5: 3       7
                        G+  Bd  Dd  F+    
    
    
    
    
    
    
```
